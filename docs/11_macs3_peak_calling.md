# Peak Calling with MACS3 (The Summit Search)

`MACS3` `peak-calling` `ChIP-seq` `narrow-peaks` `broad-peaks` `p-value` `transcription-factors`

## 1. Basic Concept (The "Heap" Hunt)

### What is a Peak?

Imagine you are looking for hidden treasure on a long beach (the Genome).

* **Random Reads:** Sand scattered everywhere evenly (Background noise).
* **A "Peak":** A huge heap of sand in one specific spot.

This heap means thousands of protein molecules were bound to that exact spot of DNA.

### Signal vs. Noise

* **Signal:** The Heap (Peak).
* **Noise:** The random thin layer of sand everywhere else (Input/Control).

**MACS3** is the software that scans the beach, measures the height of the sand pile, and calculates if it is "significantly" higher than the background.

### Narrow vs. Broad Peaks

Different histone modifications and chromatin marks create distinct peak shapes based on their biological function:

## 2. Requirements

### Input Files

You need the following files in your workspace:

**BAM files:** Located in `encode_bam/` directory

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **ENCODE Pre-processing:** These BAM files from ENCODE are already deduplicated and filtered for mapping quality (MAPQ ≥ 30). This is documented in [Tutorial 10](./10_bam_summary_fingerprint.md). You do NOT need to run additional filtering.

---

## 3. Execution (Step-by-Step)

We call peaks on **each replicate individually**, then assess reproducibility using IDR (Irreproducible Discovery Rate). This is the [ENCODE standard workflow](https://www.encodeproject.org/chip-seq/transcription_factor/).

### Step 1: Create Output Directory

```bash
mkdir -p macs3_results
```

### Step 2: H3K9ac (Narrow Peaks) - Both Replicates

H3K9ac (Acetylation) creates sharp, tall spikes at active promoters and enhancers.

**Replicate 1:**

```bash
macs3 callpeak \
  -t encode_bam/H3K9ac_ENCFF534IPX.bam \
  -c encode_bam/Input_ENCFF110SOB.bam \
  -f BAM \
  -g hs \
  -n H3K9ac_ENCFF534IPX \
  -p 0.01 \
  --keep-dup all \
  --outdir macs3_results
```

**Replicate 2:**

```bash
macs3 callpeak \
  -t encode_bam/H3K9ac_ENCFF193NPE.bam \
  -c encode_bam/Input_ENCFF919XCV.bam \
  -f BAM \
  -g hs \
  -n H3K9ac_ENCFF193NPE \
  -p 0.01 \
  --keep-dup all \
  --outdir macs3_results
```

### Expected Outputs

After running MACS3, you will have:

```bash
macs3_results/
├── H3K9ac_ENCFF534IPX_peaks.narrowPeak
├── H3K9ac_ENCFF534IPX_peaks.xls
├── ... (similar files for all 6 replicates)
└── H3K9ac_idr_peaks.txt        # After IDR analysis
```

**Parameter Explanation:**

* `-t`: Treatment file (IP sample - the enriched DNA).
* `-c`: Control file (Input - background DNA).
* `-f BAM`: Input file format.
* `-g hs`: Genome size (`hs` = human ~2.7Gb, can also use numeric `2.7e9` or `2.9e9` for hg38).
* `-n`: Output file prefix (use the ENCODE accession for clarity).
* `-p 0.01`: P-value cutoff. Keep only peaks with p-value < 0.01 (1% significance threshold).
  * **Why `-p` instead of `-q`?** We use IDR (Irreproducible Discovery Rate)  to filter for reproducible peaks between replicates. Starting with lenient `-p` thresholds captures more candidate peaks, then IDR applies stringent reproducibility filtering. This "liberal discovery + stringent validation" approach is standard for replicated ChIP-seq.
* `--keep-dup all`: For deduplicated BAM files (duplicates already removed). Use `--keep-dup 1` if BAMs still contain duplicates.
* `--outdir`: Output directory.

**Optional Parameters:**

* `-B` or `--bdg`: Generate bedGraph files for fragment pileup and control lambda.
  
* `--bdg --SPMR`: Combine with `-B` to normalize bedGraph by signal per million reads (SPMR)
* `-f BAMPE`: Explicitly specify paired-end BAM format (BAMPE = BAM with PE alignment)
  
* `--nomodel --extsize <size>`: Override automatic fragment size estimation (only needed if model building fails)

> [!NOTE]
> **Summit positions for motif analysis:** This tutorial does not use `--call-summits` in MACS3 because precise summit positions will be extracted during IDR analysis , where we identify reproducible peaks and derive consensus summits for motif discovery.

### Step 3: H3K27me3 (Broad Peaks) - Both Replicates

H3K27me3 (Trimethylation) creates wide, gentle hills marking repressed chromatin domains.

**Replicate 1:**

```bash
macs3 callpeak \
  -t encode_bam/H3K27me3_ENCFF532DQH.bam \
  -c encode_bam/Input_ENCFF110SOB.bam \
  -f BAM \
  -g hs \
  -n H3K27me3_ENCFF532DQH \
  --broad -p 0.01\
  --keep-dup all \
  --outdir macs3_results
```

**Replicate 2:**

```bash
macs3 callpeak \
  -t encode_bam/H3K27me3_ENCFF164ALR.bam \
  -c encode_bam/Input_ENCFF919XCV.bam \
  -f BAM \
  -g hs \
  -n H3K27me3_ENCFF164ALR \
   --broad -p 0.01\
  --keep-dup all \
  --outdir macs3_results
```

### Step 4: CEBPA (Narrow Peaks - Transcription Factor) - Both Replicates

Transcription factors like CEBPA bind to very specific DNA sequences, creating extremely sharp peaks.

**Replicate 1:**

```bash
macs3 callpeak \
  -t encode_bam/ceb_ENCFF327JFG.bam \
  -c encode_bam/Input_ENCFF110SOB.bam \
  -f BAM \
  -g hs \
  -n ceb_ENCFF327JFG \
  -p 0.01 \
  --keep-dup all \
  --outdir macs3_results
```

**Replicate 2:**

```bash
macs3 callpeak \
  -t encode_bam/ceb_ENCFF744SVA.bam \
  -c encode_bam/Input_ENCFF919XCV.bam \
  -f BAM \
  -g hs \
  -n ceb_ENCFF744SVA \
  -p 0.01 \
  --keep-dup all \
  --outdir macs3_results
```

## 4. Understanding the Outputs

After running the commands, inspect `macs3_results/`. For each sample, you'll see:

### File Types

#### 1. `*_peaks.narrowPeak` (or `*_peaks.broadPeak`)  [BED6 + 4 (10 cols) narrow and BED6 + 3 (9 cols) broad]

* **What is it?** The final list of called peaks.
* **Format:** BED-like format with 10 columns:
  * Columns 1-3: Chromosome, start, end
  * Column 4: Peak name
  * Column 5: Integer score (for display)
  * Column 6: Strand (always `.` for ChIP-seq)
  * Column 7: Fold enrichment
  * Column 8: -log10(p-value)
  * Column 9: -log10(q-value)
  * Column 10: Summit position (relative to start)
* **Use:** Open in IGV or use for downstream analysis (annotation, motif finding).

**View the file:**

```text
rajaishaqnabikhan@Rajas-MacBook-Pro bws % head -4 macs3_results/H3K9ac_ENCFF193NPE_peaks.narrowPeak

chr1 777980 778754 H3K9ac_ENCFF193NPE_peak_1a 67 . 3.55173 8.65761 6.72906 109
chr1 777980 778754 H3K9ac_ENCFF193NPE_peak_1b 473 . 9.73436 49.6911 47.3476 508
chr1 778874 779368 H3K9ac_ENCFF193NPE_peak_2 254 . 7.6257 27.596 25.4103 313
chr1 826684 827604 H3K9ac_ENCFF193NPE_peak_3 975 . 18.662 100.173 97.5777 717

```

**Interpreting the columns:**

* Peak `H3K9ac_ENCFF193NPE_peak_3` has the highest score (975) and fold enrichment (18.7x)
* Column 10 (e.g., 717 for peak_3) is the summit offset: summit is at position 826684+717 = 827401

#### 3. `*_peaks.xls`

* **What is it?** Excel-friendly table with detailed peak statistics.
* **Contents:** All peak coordinates plus:
  * `fold_enrichment`: How many times higher than background (e.g., 10.5 = 10.5x enrichment)
  * `-log10(pvalue)`: Statistical significance (higher = more significant)
  * `-log10(qvalue)`: FDR-corrected p-value (accounts for multiple testing)
* **Use:** Filter peaks, rank by significance, extract statistics for publication.

**Example interpretation:**

```text
Peak with fold_enrichment=15.3, -log10(qvalue)=50.2
→ Signal is 15.3x higher than background
→ q-value = 10^-50.2 ≈ 6.3e-51 (extremely significant!)
```

#### 4. `*_model.r` (narrow peaks only)

* **What is it?** R script that generates a PDF showing the shift model.
* **Use:** QC visualization showing fragment length estimation.
* **How to use:**

    ```bash
    Rscript macs3_results/H3K9ac_ENCFF534IPX_model.r >  macs3_results/H3K9ac_ENCFF534IPX_mode.pdf
    ```

## Summary

You have successfully called peaks using MACS3 for:

1. **H3K9ac** (narrow peaks, active histone mark)
2. **H3K27me3** (broad peaks, repressive mark)
3. **CEBPA** (narrow peaks, transcription factor)

**Peak calling strategy:**

* Used `-p 0.01` for lenient discovery (captures candidate peaks)
* Will apply IDR filtering in Tutorial 13 for stringent validation
* No `--call-summits` here - summits extracted during IDR analysis

> [!NOTE]
> **Up Next:** Calculate FRiP (Fraction of Reads in Peaks) quality metrics to validate peak enrichment, then assess reproducibility with IDR and perform motif discovery.
