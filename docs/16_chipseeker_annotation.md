# Annotation & Visualization

## Introduction: Decoding the Map

You have successfully defined your **Peaks** (GPS coordinates of protein binding). But coordinates alone don't tell a biological story.
**Annotation** is the process of cross-referencing these coordinates with a **Gene Map** (GTF) to answer:

* "Does my protein bind to Promoters?"
* "Is it hiding in Intergenic Deserts?"
* "Does it prefer Exons or Introns?"

Below is the full interactive report generated by **ChIPseeker**.

## How to Interpret the Figures (Reference Guide)

Since the report above contains many plots, here is a guide on how to read the most important ones:

### 1. The TSS Heatmap (Portrait Mode)

* **What it shows:** The binding intensity ±3000bp around the Transcription Start Site (TSS).
* **How to read it:**
  * **Vertical Axis:** Each line is one gene.
  * **Horizontal Axis:** Center is TSS. Left is Upstream, Right is Downstream.
  * **Key Insight:** A dark vertical stripe at the center (0) means your protein is a **Strong Promoter Binder** (like H3K9ac or Transcription Factors). A broad cloud means it's a domain mark (like H3K27me3).

### 2. The Average Profile Plot

* **What it shows:** The average signal across all genes, summarized as a line graph.
* **How to read it:**
  * **Sharp Spike at 0:** Confirms precise positioning at promoters.
  * **Dip (Valley) at 0:** Indicates the protein binds *around* the TSS (like nucleosomes) but leaves the start site open.

### 3. The Genomic Annotation Barplot

* **What it shows:** Where your peaks land (Promoter vs. Intron vs. Distal Intergenic).
* **How to read it:**
  * **High Promoter Fraction (>50%):** Your protein regulates genes directly (e.g., TFs, active histones).
  * **High Distal Intergenic:** Your protein might be an Enhancer-binding factor.
